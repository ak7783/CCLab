                    <h3>Who is Zeus?</h3>
                    <p>Zeus is the god of the sky in Ancient Greek mythology. He is considered a father and protector to
                        the gods. </p>

                    <h3>Symbolism</h3>
                    <p>Zeus is commonly depicted holding a thunderbolt and an eagle. The lightening bolt he uses to
                        impose his power, authority, and control over the skies and the natural forces. It represents
                        Zeus's role as the god of the sky, thunder, lightning, and justice. Additionally, the
                        thunderbolt serves as a symbol of divine punishment, as Zeus would use it to strike down those
                        who defied him or threatened the order of the cosmos. </p>

                    <h3>Family Overview</h3>
                    <p>Zeus is the son of Cronus and Rhea, and he led his siblings in overthrowing their father, who had
                        swallowed them at birth fearing a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him. After
                        defeating Cronus, Zeus and his siblings, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia, divided the
                        cosmos among themselves, with Zeus ruling over the sky and heavens.</p>
