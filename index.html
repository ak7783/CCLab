                <p>The Hypoctopus lives in the shallow waters and feeds off of softshell crabs, which dwell and camoflauge themselves in large patches of seaweed. It's cold-blooded nature and agile tentacles, allow the creature to live in shallow, warm waters and can be often found hovering over large patches of seaweed hunting for prey.</p>

                <h3 class="orange">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The hypnoctopus is characterized by its many slithering tentacles, large "hypnotic eye" - hence the creature's namesake - and physcial defense mechanisms. When idle, the creature floats in the water, exhibiting a warm purple hue. The hypnoctopus's prey has careful to avoid looking at the hyponotic eye. If a crab makes over 3 seconds of eye contact with the creature, it will fall into a deep sleep, which at that point, the hypoctopus can snatch them up. When provoked, the creature releases a series of toxic gas bubbles, aimed to kill any unwelcome vistors in the vicinity. Further, if one touches the main body of the hypnoctopus, they will certainly face the wrath of 45 rotating spikes. Lastly, as one more precaution, the hypnoctopus changes color based on the proximity to its attacker. The hypnoctopus will change from a purple hue, to orange, to red as the attacker gets closer, acting as a warning to stay far, far away.</p>

                <span class="blue">What we know so far about Hypnoctopus:</span>
                The hypnoctopus is a soft-bodied creature that can grow up to seventy tentacles, which it uses to manuveur through tight spaces, capture prey and to grab objects. The span of its tentacles can reach around twenty feet in length and its body can grow up to ten feet in diameter. Observed hyptoctopuses can live up to twenty years. The hypnoctopus is believed to be the direct descendant of the monoctopus, which was a dominant ocean predator throughout the Paleolithic Period. While they are mostly found off the cool waters of Northern California due to the nutrient waters and plethora of kelp forests, some smaller populations live off the coasts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, Canada. These waters are ideal for supporting diverse forms of marine life, including the hypnoctopus's main source of food: softshell crabs. The main threats to the Hypoctopus are killer whales and humans. The hypoctopus has three different methods of defense: changing of appearance, growing of spikes and the release of toxic gas.

                <span class="blue">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> If you are not a trained professional and come into contact with the hynoctopus, KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. The hypoctopus is not a human-friendly creature and prefers to be left alone. Additionally, the effects of it's toxic bubbles can be felt from over thirty feet away and effects can be lethal. Furthermore, the reach of its tentacles are deceptively long. It is recommended that one should pretend to be a floating piece of park and one they float over 40 feet away from the creature, should slowly paddle away.
